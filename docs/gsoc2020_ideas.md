# (Dummy) List of projects, GSoC 2020

### 1. Tensorflow support

**short description**: All of the neural reranker models in capreolus are currently written in pytorch. It would be great if users can easily choose from TF1 and TF2 implementations as well. Major advantage - A TF1 model can be run on TPUs, speeding up everything

**difficulty**: difficult

**pre-requisites**: Python, experience with Tensorflow, experience developing APIs, some practical experience with deep-learning models


### Non-neural baselines

**short description**: Currently, BM25 is the only available non-neural baseline. There are no dearth of effective non-neural methods for IR, eg: Probalistic Latent Semantic Indexing, Markov Random Fields, query likelihood, and so on. The goal of the project is to add support for a few of these models

**difficulty**: moderate
**pre-requisites**: python
